## About me 👋

"Work hard in silence, let your success be the noise." – Frank Ocean 

Hi, I’m Rachel Le! 

I’m a senior studying Data Science at the University of Minnesota. I have great passion for solving challenges and uncovering data-driven and actionable insights that enhance customer experiences. 

Through my data journey, I’ve completed two impactful internships. In one, I analyzed in-app feature performance using SQL, Python, and dashboards and successfully pinpointed an overlooked usage pattern that highlighted inefficient voucher allocation. My findings directly informed the Board of Directors’ quarterly planning. In the other, I developed an automated tool that saved Project Engineers six hours a day, significantly accelerating product delivery process. 
 
I take pride in being detail-oriented and resourceful. One of my proudest achievements was presenting my work to the leadership team. By anticipating questions and addressing them upfront, I delivered a confident presentation that sparked excitement about my solution and left no questions unanswered. Knowing the value it could bring made the experience incredibly rewarding. 
 
Currently, I’m actively seeking opportunities in Data Analytics, Customer Success Analytics, and Marketing Analytics to contribute to impactful projects and drive measurable outcomes. 

Beyond data, I’m a big fan of board games. I love the creative strategy and teamwork they require, much like solving data challenges. Whether it’s a game or a tough data problem, I’m happy to be *on board*!
